                  <span style="font-size: 0.75rem;"></span>Celebrities have grown in power during the last several decades. They are connected with extravagant lives, have a strong influence on others, and have more money than anybody should need. As a result, many celebrities seem to have everything they could ever desire – a gorgeous residence, a massive entourage around them at all times, and an excess of presents for themselves. However, other celebrities continue to struggle to meet basic needs such as food and housing; these are often the people you see on talk programs where they're exposed to discussions about how much money they've earned this year or where they prefer to go in the summer.<br>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-2"> These superstars seem to exude a feeling of entitlement rather than desperation. They have everything they are supposed to desire, yet they are still unsatisfied. As a celebrity lover, it's disconcerting and irritating to be dragged back down to earth by a star who seems to be affluent. One of the most prevalent reasons of celebrity failure is bad financial and investing decisions, so much so that in many situations, the creditor is also a celebrity who has given them money. Do celebrities need financial assistance? Do they make sound judgments about how much money to withdraw from their bank accounts? What are your thoughts? Please share your opinions on these issues in the comments section.<br>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-4"> Celebrity has a strong influence on our culture. They are often the face of what is deemed current and fashionable, they are generally the most paid actors and actresses in a film, they are in charge of selling goods and services to us, they influence our thoughts on who we should admire as decent human beings, and so on. Celebrity culture has grown so prevalent in our society that some individuals have created a social standing based on their admiration for celebrities. Celebrities are so essential in today's culture that even youngsters desire to be famous like the stars we see on television or the celebrities that adorn the covers of magazines on a daily basis (i.e. musicians or athletes).</p>

                        <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"></span>Celebrities earn a lot of money through acting, sports athlete roles, and music. Commercials promoting items or services affiliated with the celebrity are also shown on television. Because celebrities earn so much money, they can afford to acquire the most costly items in life. However, some celebrities may not always manage their finances effectively and wind up losing enormous sums of money, which can fast derail some of their most notable accomplishments (for example, Madonna's recent album underperformed by about fifty million dollars). <br>
                        <br>Celebrities often seek creditor loans to pay off obligations such as mortgages, vehicle loans, school loan debt, credit card debt, and so on.<br>

          <br>Observer of Celebrities <br>
          <br>Celebrities have grown in power during the last several decades. They are connected with extravagant lives, have a strong influence on others, and have more money than anybody should need. As a result, many celebrities seem to have everything they could ever desire – a gorgeous residence, a massive entourage around them at all times, and an excess of presents for themselves. However, other celebrities continue to struggle to meet basic needs such as food and housing; these are often the people you see on talk programs where they're exposed to discussions about how much money they've earned this year or where they prefer to go in the summer. <br>
          <br>These superstars seem to exude a feeling of entitlement rather than desperation. They have everything they are supposed to desire, yet they are still unsatisfied. As a celebrity lover, it's disconcerting and irritating to be dragged back down to earth by a star who seems to be affluent. One of the most prevalent reasons of celebrity failure is bad financial and investing decisions, so much so that in many situations, the creditor is also a celebrity who has given them money. Do celebrities need financial assistance? Do they make sound judgments about how much money to withdraw from their bank accounts? What are your thoughts? Please share your opinions on these issues in the comments section. <br>
          <br>Celebrity has a strong influence on our culture. They are often the face of what is deemed current and fashionable, they are generally the most paid actors and actresses in a film, they are in charge of selling goods and services to us, they influence our thoughts on who we should admire as decent human beings, and so on. Celebrity culture has grown so prevalent in our society that some individuals have created a social standing based on their admiration for celebrities. Celebrities are so essential in today's culture that even youngsters desire to be famous like the stars we see on television or the celebrities that adorn the covers of magazines on a daily basis (i.e. musicians or athletes). <br>
          <br>Celebrities earn a lot of money through acting, sports athlete roles, and music. Commercials promoting items or services affiliated with the celebrity are also shown on television. Because celebrities earn so much money, they can afford to acquire the most costly items in life. However, some celebrities may not always manage their finances effectively and wind up losing enormous sums of money, which can fast derail some of their most notable accomplishments (for example, Madonna's recent album underperformed by about fifty million dollars). <br>
          <br>Celebrities often seek creditor loans to pay off obligations such as mortgages, vehicle loans, school loan debt, credit card debt, and so on. <br>

          <br>Warner Music Group signed a contract with Buzzfeed in 2014 to analyze and distribute material for its artists. This collaboration aimed to broaden Buzzfeed's user base to attract more traditional music fans. This agreement enabled Warner Music Group artists including Ariana Grande and One Direction to upload their YouTube music videos on BuzzFeed's YouTube channel. BuzzFeed earns a cut of every ad that appears before and during the videos under this streaming arrangement. Because of the change in conventional music listeners who are younger in recent years owing to listening on streaming services such as Spotify instead of buying albums or CDs, how these advertising are dispersed is still being argued and discussed. Buzzfeed has covered other Warner Music Group acts including Ed Sheeran, Fifth Harmony, and Blackbear. <br>
          <br>The Harper's Bazaar blog post is as follows: <br>
          <br>Ariana Grande wore fuchsia nails at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards.

Enjoy and freely share with your friends. <br>

          <br>Harper's Bazaar collaborated with BuzzFeed to produce a blog piece on Ariana Grande's bright fuchsia nails during the 2016 Teen Choice Awards. This partnership represents a media trend: it's no longer enough to comment about what celebrities wear. Celebrities have also begun blogging, which allows them to express their authentic selves, answer questions, and communicate with followers through social media. <br>
          <br>On September 30, 2015, BuzzFeed published a blog article in which the celebs attended the Trevor Project's 42nd Annual Trevor Live charity performance in Los Angeles.<br>
